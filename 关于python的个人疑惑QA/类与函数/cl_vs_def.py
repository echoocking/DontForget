这里是关于使用类还是直接定义函数的一个思考
使用类的时候可以绑定变量，当传入参数过多时，可以使用self进行绑定，复用时需要提前把上一个类实例的属性进行reset

Create a function. Functions do specific things, classes are specific things.

Classes often have methods, which are functions that are associated with a particular class, and do things associated 
with the thing that the class is - but if all you want is to do something, a function is all you need.

Essentially, a class is a way of grouping functions (as methods) and data (as properties) into a logical unit revolving 
around a certain kind of thing. If you don't need that grouping, there's no need to make a class.
